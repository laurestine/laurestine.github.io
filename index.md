# About Me

I am a PhD student at the [McGill University Department of Linguistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). In my spare time, I work as a math tutor and as a math outreach instructor.

Here are some of my broad academic interests:

- Computational methods in linguistics.
- Language variation and change.
- Detailed semantic fieldwork and its relationship with semantic theory.
- The relationship between language and mathematical cognition.
- The language of mathematicians.
- Exposition and outreach.
