# About Me

I am a PhD student at the [McGill University Department of Linguistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). I also work on-and-off both as a math tutor and as a math outreach instructor.

Here are some of my broad academic interests:

- _Computational methods in linguistics._
- _Sociolinguistics_, especially as it relates to game theory and to literature.
- Detailed semantic fieldwork and its relationship with semantic theory.
- _Semantic typology._
- The relationship between language and mathematical cognition.
- Ethnomathematics and the history of math.
- _The language of mathematicians._
- _Exposition and outreach._

I am fascinated with all of these, but not experienced with most of them. I have some small experience with the italicized items.

I also like to crochet and to dance, and I am learning to bake and to play the ukulele.
