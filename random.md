I am a member of the [Only Human Dance Collective](https://www.onlyhumandancecollective.com/).

I like to crochet. Some of my proudest original creations are a goose, a large duck, and a small duck coin purse (with its own smaller duck coin purse), all pictured below. It's only a coincidence that they're all waterfowl.

One time I rewrote a Shakespeare sonnet in mathematical notation. The result is [this sonnet, "eyes(mistress) ∩ sun = ∅"](https://laurestine.github.io/sonnet.txt).

One time I imagined what names for city driving paths would be like if we expanded their abbreviations incorrectly. The result is [this decomposition and recombination of pieces of words](https://laurestine.github.io/st-reet.html).
