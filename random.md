I am a member of the [Only Human Dance Collective](https://www.onlyhumandancecollective.com/).

I crochet a lot, and I'm quite good at it. Some of my proudest original creations are a goose, a large duck, and a small duck coin purse (with smaller duck coin purse inside). It's a coincidence that they're all waterfowl; I design other things too.

I sometimes make sweet things to eat. Did you know you can make ice cream using only a large bowl, a medium metal bowl, and a hand mixer? I learned that from [this video ice-cream recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM). I also really enjoy [this recipe for chocolate chip cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20220611005353/https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies).

I really like the webcomics [Paranatural](https://www.paranatural.net/), [Cucumber Quest](http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/), and [Soul to Call](https://soultocall.com/).
