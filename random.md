I am a member of the [Only Human Dance Collective](https://www.onlyhumandancecollective.com/).

I crochet a lot, and I'm quite good at it. Some of my proudest original creations are a goose, a large duck, and a small duck coin purse (with its own smaller duck coin purse), all pictured below. It's only a coincidence that they're all waterfowl.

One time I rewrote a Shakespeare sonnet in mathematical notation. The result is [this sonnet, "eyes(mistress) ∩ sun = ∅"](https://laurestine.github.io/sonnet.txt).

One time I made a spreadsheet detailing how the three sung parts of "A Man's Gotta Do" from _Doctor Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ intermesh. The result is [this image of aligned lyrics](https://laurestine.github.io/AMGD.PNG).

One time I imagined what names for city driving paths would be like if we expanded their abbreviations incorrectly. The result is [this decomposition and recombination of pieces of words](https://laurestine.github.io/st-reet.html).

I sometimes make sweet things to eat. Did you know you can make ice cream using only a large bowl, a medium metal bowl, and a hand mixer? I learned that from [this video ice-cream recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM). I also really enjoy [this recipe for chocolate chip cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20220611005353/https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies).

I really like the webcomics [Paranatural](https://www.paranatural.net/), [Cucumber Quest](http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/), and [Soul to Call](https://soultocall.com/).
