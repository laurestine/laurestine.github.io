My name is Laurestine Bradford. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, that's /ˈlɔ.ɹəˌstiːn ˈbɹæd.fɹ̩d/. You are welcome to call me Laurestine. I am also fine with Ms. Bradford. You might hear someone call me by a nickname; that's acceptable, but usually reserved for more casual settings. Please do not call me Laurenstine.

My pronouns are she / her / hers.

My email address is Laurestine (dot) Bradford (at) mail (dot) McGill (dot) ca.
