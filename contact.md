My name is Laurestine Bradford. You are welcome to call me Laurestine. I am also fine with Ms. Bradford. You might hear someone call me by a nickname; that's acceptable, but usually reserved for more casual settings. Please do not call me Laurenstine.

My pronouns are she / her / hers.

My email address is L dot Bradford at mail dot utoronto dot ca.
