# About Me

I am currently a master's student in the [University of Toronto Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/). In September 2021, I will become a Ph. D. student at the [McGill University Department of Linguistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). In 2020, I completed a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Toronto. I am casually involved with [Professor Peter Taylor's RabbitMath project](https://www.rabbitmath.ca/), and I work on-and-off both as a math tutor and as a math outreach instructor.

Here are some of my broad academic interests:

- _Computational methods in linguistics._
- _Sociolinguistics_, especially as it relates to game theory and to literature.
- Detailed semantic fieldwork and its relationship with semantic theory.
- _Semantic typology._
- The relationship between language and mathematical cognition.
- Ethnomathematics and the history of math.
- _The language of mathematicians._
- _Exposition and outreach._

I am fascinated with all of these, but not experienced with most of them. I have some small experience with the italicized items.

I also like to crochet and to dance, and I am learning to bake and to play the ukulele.
